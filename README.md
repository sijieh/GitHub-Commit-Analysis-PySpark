# 🤖 Can AI Replace Human Software Engineers?

This project explores whether artificial intelligence can replace human software engineers by analyzing **265 million GitHub commits** from the [GitHub Archive dataset](https://www.gharchive.org/). We use **big data tools** to examine long-term trends in programming languages, licenses, developer contributions, and commit types.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To investigate whether AI can meaningfully automate software development, or if human engineers remain indispensable — especially for innovation and architectural decisions.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **Big Data Processing:** Apache Spark, PySpark  
- **Similarity Analysis:** Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Pandas  
- **Data Source:** 1.36 TiB of GitHub Archive data (2008–2022)

---

## 📊 Key Analyses

- 📈 Programming language trends over time  
- 🔐 Open-source license distribution  
- 📄 Duplicate commit detection via text similarity  
- 🧑‍💻 Productivity by author, company, and repo  
- 🧠 Identifying repetitive vs creative work

---

## 💡 Insights

- AI is well-suited for **repetitive engineering tasks** like updates and bug fixes  
- **Creative, high-impact commits** (e.g., in Linux, Chrome) remain dominated by humans  
- Most commits are low-effort; a small number of developers make meaningful contributions at scale

---

## ✅ Conclusion

AI can support and enhance the developer workflow, especially for automation and maintenance. However, the **human element remains critical** for innovation, architecture, and decision-making — suggesting a future of **human-AI collaboration**, not replacement.
